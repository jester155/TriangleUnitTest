TriangleUnitTest
================

Unitest project for Software Engineering.

This project was designed around pre-written unit tests for my Software Engineering class. We were asked to test the tree different kinds of triangles: equilateral, isosceles, scalene. As well as to test if the lengths o the sides could even make a triangle. The nature of the assign was based on unit test passing or failing and had no programming language requirements. 


Program to see what kind of triangles are what. The result is flagged by an enum or you can publicly call one of the Boolean methods.
